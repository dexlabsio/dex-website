# Launch Week & Major Release Diary

## Overview

This diary is specifically for tracking Launch Weeks and Major Release announcements on the dex website. For general website information, architecture, and development guidelines, please refer to the main `PROJECT_DIARY.md` file first.

**Current Release**: Summer 2025 Release
**Release Theme**: "Built for Scale" - Efficiency Meets Scale
**Page Location**: `/app/blog/summer-2025-release/page.tsx`

## Launch Week Structure & Components

### Page Architecture
Launch Week pages follow a consistent structure optimized for feature announcements:

1. **Hero Section** - Main announcement with compelling title and single CTA
2. **Features Overview** - Centered illustration with grid of all features
3. **Feature Detail Sections** - Individual deep-dive sections for each feature
4. **Consistent Spacing** - Reduced spacing between sections (`py-12 sm:py-16`)
5. **Visual Consistency** - Professional styling with videos, screenshots, and illustrations

### Design System for Launch Pages

#### Spacing Standards
- **Hero to Features**: `py-12 sm:py-16` (reduced from standard `py-24 sm:py-32`)
- **Feature Sections**: `py-12 sm:py-16` for consistency
- **Content Width**: `max-w-container` for full-width sections, `max-w-4xl` for readable text

#### Visual Elements
- **16:9 Aspect Ratio**: All videos and illustrations use `aspect-video`
- **Bordered Screenshots**: Use layered border system for premium feel
- **Dividers**: Simple `border-t border-gray-200` between feature sections
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons in indigo circular backgrounds (`bg-indigo-600`)

4. **Professional Tone**: Balance excitement with enterprise credibility

### Content Structure per Feature
```
1. Problem Statement (1 paragraph)
2. Solution & Capabilities (1-2 paragraphs)
3. Benefits & Availability (1 paragraph)
```

### Visual Content Strategy
- **Hero Illustration**: 16:9 overview illustration showing all features
- **Feature Videos**: Demo videos showing actual functionality
- **Supporting Screenshots**: Real UI screenshots for context
- **Performance Data**: Charts, benchmarks, comparison tables

## Technical Implementation

### File Organization
```
/app/blog/[release-name]/page.tsx
/public/[Release Name]/
  ├── videos/
  ├── screenshots/
  └── illustrations/
```

### Component Patterns
- Use existing `max-w-container` for consistency
- Maintain responsive design patterns
- Include proper alt text for accessibility
- Use semantic HTML structure

### Video Integration
```tsx
<video
  className="aspect-video rounded-xl shadow-2xl ring-1 ring-gray-900/10 w-full"
  controls
  preload="metadata"
>
  <source src="/[Release Name]/[video-name].mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

### Image Integration
```tsx
<img
  src="/[Release Name]/[image-name].png"
  alt="Descriptive alt text"
  className="aspect-video rounded-xl shadow-2xl ring-1 ring-gray-900/10 w-full object-cover"
